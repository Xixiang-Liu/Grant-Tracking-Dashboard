# Grant-Tracking-Dashboard
COMP 523, Fall 2022, Team E

## About The Project
Our client, Triangle Bikeworks, provides cycling-related growth opportunities for local youth. This semester, we’ll work with our client to create a web-based expense tracking bashboard.

In the past, our client used Excel spreadsheet and Quickbooks to track its programs’ expense. However, Excel and Quickbooks have their limits. The client would like us to create a standby app that allow them to better track the expense, in which they can apply filters, track the expense against their budget, and run comparison between years for the same line item.
